Version 0.1.1 of gh-pages-blog was just released.

This version is pretty much the same as the previous version with the following few changes:
* Fixed an issue where `<pre>` blocks were not rendered correctly
* Increased the spacing between paragraphs in blog posts
* Added a better README to the GitHub project

Happy blogging.
