I just setup my Twitter account. Find me at [twitter](https://twitter.com/mhiggins2000) .

more for testing.

Version 0.3.1 of gh-pages-blog was just released.

This is a minor release that fixes a few bugs. The first bug was a duplicate 'a' that has been removed. The second was an invalid &lt;docs&gt; reference in the rss.xml. Thanks to [larsks](https://github.com/larsks) for both discovering the bugs and providing the fixes. The third bug was a javascript issue causing only a single post to show when filtering by category.

This release also defaults all links to use https instead of http, and fixes a bunch of typos.
